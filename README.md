# Event Management Web App

Welcome to my vent Management Web App!
This app allows users to create, update, and delete events (e.g., conferences, concerts) and track attendees. It provides an easy-to-use frontend for user interaction and basic server communication using APIs.

## Problem Statement

Organizing and managing events can be difficult and time-consuming, especially for large groups. Many individuals and organizations need help with keeping track of events, attendees, and key information, leading to inefficiencies. A centralized online platform would streamline the event management process, making organizing, updating, and communicating event details easier.

## Solution Statement

This web application lets users easily create, edit, and delete events while viewing upcoming events and attendee details. Users can track important information like event dates, locations, and weather forecasts, ensuring seamless planning and attendance. In the future, this app will support user feedback through comments on event pages.

## Project MVP/User Stories
